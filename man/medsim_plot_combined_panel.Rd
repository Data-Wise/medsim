\title{Create Combined Multi-Panel Figure}
\usage{
medsim_plot_combined_panel(
  results,
  panels = c("error", "timing"),
  layout = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A medsim_results object or named list of results objects}

\item{panels}{Character vector: which panels to include. Options:
"error", "timing", "coverage" (default: c("error", "timing"))}

\item{layout}{Character: layout specification like "2x1", "1x2", "2x2"
(default: auto-determined from number of panels)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to individual plotting functions}
}
\value{
A combined plot object (patchwork or gridExtra)
}
\description{
Creates a combined figure with multiple panels for manuscript submission.
Useful for showing multiple aspects of simulation results in one figure.
}
\details{
Requires either \code{patchwork} or \code{gridExtra} package for combining plots.

# Two-panel figure
